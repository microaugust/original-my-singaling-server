WebRTC Video and Signaling sample
=================================

This sample demonstrates how to use WebSockets to create a signaling server for WebRTC calling. The signaling server is based on the WebSocket, opening a video call to another user by clicking on their name in the user list sidebar.

See the article [Signaling and video calling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling) on MDN for detailed information on how this code works.


Original example at https://github.com/mdn/samples-server/tree/master/s/webrtc-from-chat doesn't work properly. This project fixing it and use only video call, without a chatbox.
